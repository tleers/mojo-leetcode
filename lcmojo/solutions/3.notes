So, solving LC3 is difficult if we try to do it the Python way.

Everything starts to break down as soon as we need a hash table, in Python, typically, the dictionary.
There is no implementation of a HashTable or dictionary in Mojo.

Using the PythonObject approach fails because the conversion from
PythonObject to Mojo Int or Object is not supported today.

So we're taking a less optimal approach that uses a List to keep track of
seen elements.
