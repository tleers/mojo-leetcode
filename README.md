# Get started: Install Mojo

Currently, it's advised to use Github Codespaces for free to set up your Linux development environment with Mojo binaries. 
However, it's also possible to use the Mojo playground instead. For more instructions to set up Mojo on a Linux machine, look here:
https://developer.modular.com/download

Alternatively, if you're on a Linux machine, you can just use `sh initialise_mojo.sh` and wait until `Mojo` is installed on your machine

Trying to improve my fundamental algorithms & data structures as well as pick up Mojo along the way. Maybe vice versa.
Follow along as I create probably quite naive solutions for Leetcode problems with Mojo.

If you want to try yourself, install Mojo: https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/get-started/

Mojo promises to be a rather "big deal": https://docs.modular.com/mojo/why-mojo.html

I'll update the rationale a bit more in the near future.

TODO: structure this readme and add benchmarks for solutions vs. python
